# ros2_roamadome

A ROS2 hardware interface for the [Roam-A-Dome](https://github.com/reeltwo/DomeControlFirmware) controller, which manages dome positioning for R2-D2 models and similar projects.

## Overview

This package provides a ROS2 control hardware interface that integrates with the Roam-A-Dome controller firmware. It exposes the dome joint through standard ROS2 hardware interfaces, allowing controllers and motion planning nodes to command and monitor dome position and velocity.

### Key Features

- **Hardware Interface**: Implements `ActuatorInterface` for ROS2 control framework
- **State Interfaces**: Exposes dome joint position and velocity feedback
- **Command Interfaces**: Accepts position and velocity commands for dome movement
- **Pluginlib-based**: Loadable as a ROS2 controller plugin

## Hardware Background

The [Roam-A-Dome](https://github.com/reeltwo/DomeControlFirmware) (RDH) is an Arduino-based controller board for dome positioning systems. It supports:

- **Multiple Board Variants**: Arduino Mega, ESP32, ESP32S2, ESP32S3 with optional LCD displays
- **Controls**: Motor speed, acceleration/deceleration ramping, homing, and autonomous movement modes
- **Communication**: 
  - Serial packet protocol for command/control
  - PWM input/output support
  - WiFi support (ESP32 variants)
  - Droid Remote support for app-based control
- **Positioning**: Absolute and relative dome rotation with configurable speed profiles

For complete hardware documentation, see the [DomeControlFirmware repository](https://github.com/reeltwo/DomeControlFirmware).

## Interfaces

### State Interfaces

The controller exports the following state interfaces for the `dome_joint`:

| Interface | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| `dome_joint/position` | Current dome position in radians (0-2π) |
| `dome_joint/velocity` | Current dome angular velocity in rad/s |

### Command Interfaces

The controller accepts the following command interfaces for the `dome_joint`:

| Interface | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| `dome_joint/position` | Desired dome position in radians |
| `dome_joint/velocity` | Desired dome angular velocity in rad/s |

## Dependencies

- **ROS2 Dependencies**:
  - `hardware_interface`: Hardware abstraction layer
  - `controller_manager`: Manages lifecycle and plugins
  - `pluginlib`: Dynamic plugin loading
  - `rclcpp`: C++ ROS2 client library

## Building

Build the package using `colcon`:

```bash
cd ~/r2_ws
colcon build --packages-select ros2_roamadome
```

## Usage

### Hardware Configuration

To use this hardware interface, include it in your ROS2 hardware configuration URDF or YAML file. The hardware interface will be loaded by the controller manager as a pluginlib plugin.

Example configuration:

```yaml
hardware:
  - name: roamadome_control
    type: ros2_roamadome/RoamadomeControl
```

### Launching Controllers

Once the hardware interface is loaded, you can load controllers (e.g., a position controller) that interact with the dome joint:

```bash
ros2 control load_controller dome_position_controller
ros2 control set_controller_state dome_position_controller active
```

### Commanding the Dome

Commands can be published to controller topics or issued via the controller manager interface.

## Setting up the Hardware Device

Before using this interface:

1. **Program the Roam-A-Dome**: Program the controller board with the DomeControlFirmware
2. **Serial Configuration**: Configure via serial commands (see firmware documentation)
3. **Homing**: Perform initial homing calibration either via serial, LCD menu, or hardware setup
4. **Connection**: Establish serial communication from ROS2 host to the controller

For detailed hardware setup instructions, see the [DomeControlFirmware README](https://github.com/reeltwo/DomeControlFirmware#readme).

## Serial Protocol

This interface communicates with the hardware via the Roam-A-Dome serial protocol. Common commands:

- `:DPA<degrees>` - Rotate dome to absolute position (0-359°)
- `:DPH` - Return dome to home position
- `:DPR<speed>` - Rotate dome continuously
- `:DPS<number>` - Play stored sequence

For a complete list of commands and configuration options, refer to the [hardware documentation](https://github.com/reeltwo/DomeControlFirmware#serial-configuration-commands).

## Development Notes

- The current implementation provides basic state/command interface export and is structured for future hardware communication development
- Position wraps around at 2π radians (360°)
- Velocity is calculated based on position commands and timing
- Read/write cycle timing is managed by the ROS2 controller manager
